# Publicly Available Datasets For Electric Load Forecasting
A (hopefully eventually) complete listing of the most popular electric LF datasets

### Why?
We found it difficult to find suitable datasets in the flood of information. 
So we came up with the idea of doing a proper search and making the results available to the public.


### What?
Based on a sample set of representative publications, relevant, publicly accessible data sets were extracted, structured and analyzed. 
The details of the search can be found in the scientific publication: `Placeholder - paper is in review right now`

### Improvements? ü§ù
We are happy about any kind of cooperation, feedback or extension to make the list even more valuable for other scientists. 
So feel free to expand the list and initiate a pull request.
